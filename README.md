# P/E/T/S (Rewritten)
So as it turns out, Construct 2 wasn't exactly a good idea for this game.
Rewriting the whole game in Godot now, which will probably take a while,
but it's alright because someone made an RPG template as a starting point!
For the original P/E/T/S on C2, I had to write the scripts to make dialog
boxes, doors, enemies, etc. all on my own, but it's kinda nice that I don't
have to redo all that work because someone else already made it for free here.

Template's currently all GDScript, but the project will probably include C# at
some point, and maybe even Rust too, if it isn't too complicated to get that set up. ðŸ¦€

Feel free to submit PRs and whatever, but I can't guarantee I'll be too active.

This game is... well, obviously... open-source software.
